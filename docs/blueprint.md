## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid Blue (#3498db), representing innovation and user-friendliness.
- Background color: Light gray (#f0f2f5), provides a clean and modern backdrop with a subtle glassmorphic effect.
- Accent color: Energetic Orange (#e67e22), used to highlight important actions and interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, used for a clean and modern look for both headlines and body text. Ensure readability and accessibility for optimal UX.
- Use a consistent set of line icons throughout the interface, ensuring clarity and scannability. The icons should be simple and intuitive.
- Maintain a consistent grid system for spacing and alignment, and the components should be spaced generously. Focus on a clean, simple, and intuitive layout for the best UX.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions. Animations should be smooth and non-intrusive to enhance the user experience. Give transition and loading animations for smooth flow and navigation between pages
